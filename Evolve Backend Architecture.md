# Evolve Backend Architecture

## Overview
Evolve is a free, open-source alternative to Manus AI that provides similar functionality without subscription costs. This document outlines the simplified backend architecture designed to support the core features while maintaining compatibility with the existing frontend.

## Design Principles
- **Simplicity**: Focus on essential features without unnecessary complexity
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns for maintainability
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones
- **Compatibility**: Seamless integration with the existing frontend
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of requests and background tasks

## Core Components

### 1. API Layer
- FastAPI application with RESTful endpoints
- JWT authentication for secure access
- CORS middleware for frontend integration
- Request validation and error handling

### 2. Business Logic Layer
- Agent management (create, read, update, delete)
- Agent execution and task handling
- Tool integration and management
- Knowledge base integration

### 3. Data Access Layer
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions
- PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- Redis for caching and task queue management

### 4. Background Processing
- Celery for asynchronous task execution
- Task scheduling and monitoring
- Long-running agent execution handling

### 5. Integration Layer
- LLM provider integrations (OpenAI, local models, etc.)
- External tool integrations
- File storage and management

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
1. **Users**
   - Basic user information
   - Authentication details

2. **Agents**
   - Agent configuration
   - Associated tools and workflows
   - Status and metadata

3. **AgentExecutions**
   - Execution history and status
   - Input/output logs
   - Performance metrics

4. **Tools**
   - Tool definitions and configurations
   - Integration parameters
   - Usage statistics

5. **Knowledge**
   - Document storage
   - Vector embeddings
   - Retrieval configurations

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `/auth/login` - User login
- `/auth/register` - User registration

### Agent Management
- `/agents` - CRUD operations for agents
- `/agents/{id}/config` - Agent configuration
- `/agents/{id}/tools` - Tool management for agents

### Agent Execution
- `/executions` - List and create executions
- `/executions/{id}` - Execution details and control
- `/executions/{id}/logs` - Execution logs and feedback

### Tools and Resources
- `/tools` - Available tools
- `/resources` - Resource management
- `/knowledge` - Knowledge base management

## Deployment Architecture
- Docker containerization for all components
- Docker Compose for local development
- Simple deployment process for production environments

## Security Considerations
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure storage of credentials and API keys

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up basic FastAPI application structure
2. Implement database models and migrations
3. Develop core API endpoints
4. Integrate with LLM providers
5. Implement background processing
6. Connect with frontend
7. Test and validate functionality
