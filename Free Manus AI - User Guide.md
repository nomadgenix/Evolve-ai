## Overview

Free Manus AI is built on SuperAGI, a powerful open-source autonomous agent framework. It provides capabilities similar to Manus.im, including:

- Autonomous task execution
- Multi-modal processing (text, images, code)
- Advanced tool integration
- Adaptive learning
- Web-based interface
- No subscription costs or login requirements

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - CPU: 4+ cores
  - RAM: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
  - Storage: 20GB minimum
  - GPU: Optional but recommended for local model inference

- **Software Requirements**:
  - Docker and Docker Compose
  - Git
  - Modern web browser
  - Internet connection (for initial setup)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI.git
   cd SuperAGI
   ```

2. **Configure the System**:
   ```bash
   cp config_template.yaml config.yaml
   ```
   
   Edit `config.yaml` to set up your preferences (see the Implementation Guide for detailed configuration options).

3. **Start the System**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up --build
   ```
   
   For GPU support:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-gpu.yml up --build
   ```

4. **Access the Web Interface**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Using the Web Interface

### Home Screen

The Free Manus AI interface features a red background theme and provides immediate access to all features without requiring login. The main components include:

1. **Navigation Bar**: Access features, documentation, and community resources
2. **Chat Interface**: Directly interact with your AI assistant
3. **Feature Cards**: Quick overview of available capabilities

### Creating Tasks

1. Type your request in the chat input field
2. Click "Send" or press Enter
3. The AI will process your request and respond with results or follow-up questions

### Example Tasks

- "Research the latest developments in renewable energy"
- "Create a marketing plan for a small business"
- "Analyze this dataset and create visualizations"
- "Write a blog post about artificial intelligence"
- "Help me debug this code snippet"

## Features

### Autonomous Task Execution

Free Manus AI can independently execute complex tasks such as:

- Report writing
- Data analysis
- Content generation
- Travel itinerary planning
- File processing

### Multi-Modal Capabilities

Process and generate multiple types of data:

- **Text**: Generate reports, answer queries, create content
- **Images**: Analyze visual content, understand charts and diagrams
- **Code**: Generate, review, and debug code in various programming languages

### Advanced Tool Integration

Integrate with external tools including:

- Web browsers for real-time information retrieval
- Code editors for programming assistance
- Database systems for data management
- Document processors for content creation

### Adaptive Learning

The system learns from interactions to provide increasingly personalized and efficient responses over time through:

- Memory storage using vector databases
- Context-aware responses
- User preference learning

## Customization

### Using Different Language Models

Free Manus AI supports various language models:

1. **Local Models** (completely free):
   - Llama 3
   - Mistral
   - Falcon
   
   Configure in `config.yaml` under the `models` section.

2. **API-Based Models** (requires your own API keys):
   - OpenAI models
   - Anthropic models
   - Other compatible providers

### Adding Custom Tools

Extend functionality by creating custom tools:

1. Navigate to the `superagi/tools` directory
2. Create a new Python file following the template structure
3. Implement the required methods
4. Restart the application to load the new tool

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Container Startup Issues

**Problem**: Docker containers fail to start properly.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose logs superagi

# Restart containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Performance Issues

**Problem**: System running slowly or unresponsively.

**Solution**:
- Increase allocated resources in Docker settings
- Use a quantized model version if using local models
- Optimize vector database settings

#### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Cannot connect to the web interface.

**Solution**:
- Verify Docker containers are running: `docker ps`
- Check if the port is accessible: `curl http://localhost:3000`
- Ensure no firewall is blocking the connection
