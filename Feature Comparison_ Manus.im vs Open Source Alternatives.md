## Recommendation

Based on the feature comparison, **Self-Hosted SuperAGI** offers the closest match to Manus.im's capabilities while being completely free when self-hosted. It provides:

1. Advanced autonomous task execution
2. Multi-modal capabilities
3. Extensive tool integration
4. Basic adaptive learning
5. Web-based interface
6. Completely free when self-hosted

For users willing to invest more development effort, a custom solution built with LangChain could potentially offer even greater flexibility and feature parity with Manus.im, though it would require significantly more technical expertise to implement.
